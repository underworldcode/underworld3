# Build and Development Scripts

This directory contains shell scripts for various development tasks:

- **build_api_docs.sh** - Generate API documentation
- **clean.sh** - Clean up build artifacts
- **compile.sh** - Compile the project
- **test.sh** - Run test suite

These scripts were moved from the root directory to keep the project root clean and organized.
