When you are happy that things are working OK, you can move along to look at the full documentation or the benchmarking repository.\nThe notebooks introduce the concept of meshing to describe the domain and boundary conditions for a model and progress through Eulerian data containers, symbolic operators (functions, compositions, derivatives, evaluations). The examples move on to the template PDE solvers for scalar and vector problems (in this case the Poisson equation and the Stokes equation) and time dependent, coupled problems (a simple convection example in an annulus geometry). They cover constitutive models, boundary conditions and visualisation. The final examples deal with Lagrangian data containers (particle swarms), first transporting them in a velocity field, and second, accessing the symbolic forms of their data for use in underworld expressions.",

    "text": "Underworld Documentation and Examples\nIn addition to the notebooks in this brief set of examples, there are a number of sources of information on using Underworld3 that you can access:\n\nThe Underworld Website / Blog\nThe API documentation (all the modules and functions and their full sets of arguments) is automatically generated from the source code and uses the same rich markdown content as the notebook help text.\nThe underworld3 GitHub repository is the most active development community for the code.\n\n\n\nBenchmarks\nThe Underworld3 Benchmarks Repository is a useful place to find community benchmarks coded in underworld3 along with accuracy and convergence analysis. This is an open repository where you can make a pull request with new benchmark submissions once you get the hang of things.\n\n\nThe Underworld Community\nThe Underworld Community organisation on Github is a collection of contributed repositories from the underworld user community for all versions of the code and now includes scripts for underworld3.\n\n\nParallel Execution\nUnderworld3 is inherently parallel and designed for high performance computing. The symbolic layer is a relatively thin veneer that sits on top of the PETSc machinery. A script that has been developed in jupyter should be transferrable to an HPC environment with no changes (except that inherently serial operations such as visualisation and model reduction are best left to postprocessing / co-processing).\nWe recommend installing jupytext which allows either a seamless two-way conversion (or pairing) between the ipynb format and an annotated python script, or the ability to work entirely with annoted python scripts and not use ipynb at all. The python form does not store the output of notebook cells but there are advantages to this when scripts are under version control.\nAlmost all of our notebook examples are annotated python for this reason.An exception is the collection of notebooks in this quick-start guide because we want to show you the rendered output in the static web pages.\n    mpirun -np 1024 python3 Modelling_Script.py -uw_resolution 96\nThe main difference between the notebook development environment and HPC is the lack of interactivity, particularly in sending parameters to the script at launch time. Typically, we expect the HPC version to be running at much higher resolution, or for many more timesteps than the development notebook. We use the PETSc command line parsing machinery to generate notebooks that also can ingest run-time parameters from a script (as above).\n\n\nAdvanced capabilities\nDigging a bit deeper into underworld3, there are many capabilities that require a clear understanding of the concepts that underlie the implementation. The following examples are not plug-and-play, but they do only require python coding using the underworld3 API and no detailed knowledge of petsc4py or PETSc. Get in touch with us if you want to try this sort of thing but can’t figure it out for yourself.\n\nDeforming meshes\nIn Example 8, we made small variations to the mesh to conform to basal topography. We did not remesh, so we had to be careful to apply a smooth, analytic displacement to every node. For more general free-surface models, we need to calculate a smooth function using the computed boundary motions (e.g, solving a poisson equation with known boundary displacements as boundary conditions). We need to step through time and it is common to stabilize the surface motions through a surface integral term that accounts for the interface displacement during the timestep. The example below shows an underworld3 forward model with internal loads timestepped close to isostatic equilibrium.\n\n\n\nStokes flow driven by buoyancy in an annulus defined by two embedded surfaces within an enveloping disk mesh. The surfaces deform in response to the flow. The embedding medium has a very low viscosity but still acts to damp rotational modes. The outer boundary of the disk can be set to a far-field gravitational potential for whole-Earth relaxation models\n\n\nIn a more general case, we need to account to horizontal motions. This is more complicated because the horizontal velocities can be large even when vertical equilibrium is achieved. So we need to solve for the advected component of vertical motion in addition to the local component. Hooray for symbolic algebra !\n\n\nWeak / penalty boundary conditions\nExample 8 introduced the idea of penalty-based boundary conditions where the constraint is weakly enforced by providing a large penalty for violation of the condition. This is very flexible as the penalizing conditions can be adjusted during the run, including changing which part of the boundary is subject to constraints based on the solution or a coupled problem. The channel flow model shown below has a boundary condition that depends on a externally sourced model for ponded material at the base that is derived from a simple topography filling algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nLive Image: Stokes flow in a channel with multiple obstructions. Flow is driven from the inlet (a velocity boundary condition). The geometry was contructed with gmsh. This is an example for education which demonstrates the emergence of an large-scale pressure gradient as a result of the presence of the obstructions, and also the dispersion of tracers through the complicated flow geometry\nThe penalty approach does allow the solution to deviate from the exact value of the boundary condition, in a similar way to the iterative solvers delivering a solution to within a specified tolerance. There are some cases, for example, enforcing plate motions at the surface, where there are uncertainties in the applied boundary conditions and that these uncertainties may vary in space and time.\n\n\nMesh Adaptation\nIt is also possible to use the PETSc mesh adaption capabilities, to refine the resolution of a model where it is most needed and coarsen elsewhere. Dynamically-adapting meshes are possible but the interface is very low level at present, particularly in parallel.\n\n\n\n\nLive Image: Static mesh adaptation to the slope of a field. The driving buoyancy term is three plume-like upwellings and the slope of this field is shown in colour (red high, blue low). The adapted mesh is shown in green.\n\n    # t is the driving \"temperature\". We form an isotropic refinement metric from its slope\n\n    refinement_fn = 1.0 + sympy.sqrt(\n          t.diff(x) ** 2\n        + t.diff(y) ** 2\n        + t.diff(z) ** 2\n    )\n\n    icoord, meshA = adaptivity.mesh_adapt_meshVar(mesh0, refinement_fn, Metric, redistribute=True)",

They are distributed with the source code on GitHub and can be run on binder.\n\n\nNotebook 1 - Meshes\nMeshes: Introduces the mesh discretisation that we use in Underworld3 and how you can build one of the pre-defined meshes. This notebook also show you how to use the pyvista visualisation tools for Underworld3 objects. The mesh holds information on the mesh geometry, boundaries and coordinate systems.\n\n\nNotebook 2 - Mesh Variables\nVariables: Introduces the concept of MeshVariables in Underworld3. These are both data containers and sympy symbolic objects. We show you how to inspect a meshVariable, set the data values in the MeshVariable and visualise them.\n\n\nNotebook 3 - Symbols and sympy\nSymbols: meshVariables are sympy objects that can be composed with other symbolic objects and evaluated numerically when required. They can also be differentiated. Most importantly, sympy can manipulate expressions, simplify them and cancel terms.\n\n\nNotebook 4 - Example: Diffusion Equation\nDiffusion Solver: Introduces the various solver templates that are available in Underworld, starting with a steady-state diffusion problem. The template requires you to set some constitutive properties and define the unknowns. These are handled through subsitution into symbolic forms and the template equation can be inspected before you need to supply concrete expressions.\n\n\nNotebook 5 - Example: Stokes Equation\nStokes Solver: Stokes equation is a more complicated system of equations to solve. This complexity is mostly hidden when you set the problem up. There are some interesting ways to constrain boundary values which are demonstrated using an annulus mesh (curved, free-slip boundaries) and a \\(\\delta\\) function buoyancy source.\n\n\nNotebook 6 - Example: Time Dependence\nTimestepping: Coupled Stokes flow plus thermal advection-diffusion gives a simple convection solver. The timestepping loop is written by hand because usually you will want to do some analysis or output some checkpoints.\n\n\nNotebook 7 - Example: Navier-Stokes Equation\nUnsteady flow Using a passive swarm to track the pattern of flow developing in a pipe after an impulsive application of a boundary condition at the inflow. Particles need to be added to the passive swarm close to the inflow at each timestep.\n\n\nNotebook 8 - Lagrangian Swarm Variables\nSwarm Variables - exploring how they work for specifying material properties with a swarm used to determine element viscosity.

    "text": "More information\nWe can add discrete variables (unknowns associated with the mesh points).\nThis example shows how we can add a scalar field with a single value associated with each mesh node, and a vector field which has quadratic interpolation (points at the nodes plus interpolating points along mesh edges).\nTo set values of the variable, we first have to unlock it using the access context manager, and then we can evaluate a function at the coordinates appropriate to fill up each variable. The locking is a PETSc requirement which is used to make sure data remains synchronised when we run code in parallel.\nVariables are like most underworld and PETSc objects - they can be examined using their view() method. The information that you will see is split into the underworld representation (listed under MeshVariable) and the PETSc representation (listed under FE Data which also includes the numerical values).\nThe meshVariable code is described in the API docs: https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/main_api/underworld3/meshing.html",

In this case, we are adding new particles near the inflow to track the flow.\nNow that you have seen the structure of the flow in this example, can you adjust the addition of particles to capture the structure more clearly ?\nThis is a very low-resolution example.

    "text": "Deform the mesh\nWe used a particle swarm to track the flow in Example 7. We called this a “passive” swarm because the points did not influence the flow in any way but was simply carried along.\nParticle swarms are unstructured data objects that live within the computational domain. Their points can be moved arbitrarily through the domain and points may migrate from one process to another when the coordinates are changed. By default they carry only the particle location, but we can add scalar, vector and tensor variables to the swarm and they will be transported with the particles.\nParticle transport is usually through a velocity or displacement field that incrementally changes the locations. This is a common use, but particles can be used to represent any unstructured field. For example, during mesh adaptation, the nodal points from the previous mesh are equivalent to a disconnected swarm from the point of view of the new mesh. The same is true when reading data save from one mesh to the MeshVariables on another.\nMove all nodes down to meet an undulating lower surface. The displacement field is smooth and continuous, so there is no particular need to remesh in this case.
