When you are happy that things are working OK, you can move along to look at the full documentation or the benchmarking repository.\nThe notebooks introduce the concept of meshing to describe the domain and boundary conditions for a model and progress through Eulerian data containers, symbolic operators (functions, compositions, derivatives, evaluations). The examples move on to the template PDE solvers for scalar and vector problems (in this case the Poisson equation and the Stokes equation) and time dependent, coupled problems (a simple convection example in an annulus geometry). They cover constitutive models, boundary conditions and visualisation. The final examples deal with Lagrangian data containers (particle swarms), first transporting them in a velocity field, and second, accessing the symbolic forms of their data for use in underworld expressions.",

    "text": "Underworld Documentation and Examples\nIn addition to the notebooks in this brief set of examples, there are a number of sources of information on using Underworld3 that you can access:\n\nThe Underworld Website / Blog\nThe API documentation (all the modules and functions and their full sets of arguments) is automatically generated from the source code and uses the same rich markdown content as the notebook help text.\nThe API documentation (development branch)\nThe underworld3 GitHub repository is the most active development community for the code.\n\n\n\nBenchmarks\nThe Underworld3 Benchmarks Repository is a useful place to find community benchmarks coded in underworld3 along with accuracy and convergence analysis. This is an open repository where you can make a pull request with new benchmark submissions once you get the hang of things.\n\n\nThe Underworld Community\nThe Underworld Community organisation on Github is a collection of contributed repositories from the underworld user community for all versions of the code and now includes scripts for underworld3.\n\n\nParallel Execution\nUnderworld3 is inherently parallel and designed for high performance computing. The symbolic layer is a relatively thin veneer that sits on top of the PETSc machinery. A script that has been developed in jupyter should be transferrable to an HPC environment with no changes (except that inherently serial operations such as visualisation and model reduction are best left to postprocessing / co-processing).\nWe recommend installing jupytext which allows either a seamless two-way conversion (or pairing) between the ipynb format and an annotated python script, or the ability to work entirely with annoted python scripts and not use ipynb at all. The python form does not store the output of notebook cells but there are advantages to this when scripts are under version control.\nAlmost all of our notebook examples are annotated python for this reason.An exception is the collection of notebooks in this quick-start guide because we want to show you the rendered output in the static web pages.\n    mpirun -np 1024 python3 Modelling_Script.py -uw_resolution 96\nThe main difference between the notebook development environment and HPC is the lack of interactivity, particularly in sending parameters to the script at launch time. Typically, we expect the HPC version to be running at much higher resolution, or for many more timesteps than the development notebook. We use the PETSc command line parsing machinery to generate notebooks that also can ingest run-time parameters from a script (as above).\n\nParallel scaling / performance\nRunning geodynamic models on a single CPU/processor (i.e. serial) is time-consuming and limits us to low resolution. Underworld is build from the ground-up as a parallel computing solution which means we can easily run large models on high performance computing clusters (HPC); that is, sub-divide the problem into many smaller chunks and use multiple processors to solve each one, taking care to combine and synchronise the answers from each processor to obtain the correct solution to the original problem.\nParallel computation can reduce time we need to wait for the our results to be computed but it does happen at the expense of some overhead The overhead does depend on the nature of the computer we are using but typically we need to think about:\n\nCode complexity: any time we manage computations across different processors, we have additional coding to reassemble the calculations correctly and we need to think about many special cases. For example, integrating a quantity of the surface of a mesh: many processes contribute, some do not, the results have to be computed independently then combined.\nAdditional memory is often required: to manage copies of information that lives on / near boundaries, to store the topology of the decomposed domain and to help navigate the passing of information between processes.\nThe time taken to synchronise results and the work required to keep track of who is doing what, when they are done, and in making sure everyone waits for everyone else. There is a time-cost in actually sending information as part of a synchronisation and a computational cost in ensuring that work is distributed efficiently.\n\nTo determine the efficiency of parallel computation, we introduce the strong scaling test which measures the time taken to solve a problem in parallel compared to the same problem solved in serial. In strong scaling tests, the size of the problem is kept constant, while the number of processors is increased. The reduction in run-time due to the addition of more processors is commonly expressed in terms of the speed-up:\n\\[\n\\textrm{speed up} = \\frac{t(N_{ref})}{t(N)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(t(N_{ref})\\) is the run-time for a reference number of processors, \\(N_{ref}\\), and \\(t(N)\\) is the run-time when \\(N\\) processors are used. In the ideal case, \\(N\\) additional processors should contribute all of its resources in solving the problem and reduce the compute time by a factor of \\(N\\) relative to the reference run time. For example, using \\(2 N_{ref}\\) processors will ideally halve the run-time resulting to a speed-up = 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Strong parallel-scaling tests run on Australia’s peak computing system, GADI, at the National Computational Infrastructure. This is a typical High Performance Computing facility with large numbers of dedicated, identical CPUs and fast communication links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced capabilities\nDigging a bit deeper into underworld3, there are many capabilities that require a clear understanding of the concepts that underlie the implementation. The following examples are not plug-and-play, but they do only require python coding using the underworld3 API and no detailed knowledge of petsc4py or PETSc. Get in touch with us if you want to try this sort of thing but can’t figure it out for yourself.\n\nDeforming meshes\nIn Example 8, we made small variations to the mesh to conform to basal topography. We did not remesh, so we had to be careful to apply a smooth, analytic displacement to every node. For more general free-surface models, we need to calculate a smooth function using the computed boundary motions (e.g, solving a poisson equation with known boundary displacements as boundary conditions). We need to step through time and it is common to stabilize the surface motions through a surface integral term that accounts for the interface displacement during the timestep. The example below shows an underworld3 forward model with internal loads timestepped close to isostatic equilibrium.\n\n\n\nStokes flow driven by buoyancy in an annulus defined by two embedded surfaces within an enveloping disk mesh. The surfaces deform in response to the flow. The embedding medium has a very low viscosity but still acts to damp rotational modes. The outer boundary of the disk can be set to a far-field gravitational potential for whole-Earth relaxation models\n\n\nIn a more general case, we need to account to horizontal motions. This is more complicated because the horizontal velocities can be large even when vertical equilibrium is achieved. So we need to solve for the advected component of vertical motion in addition to the local component. Hooray for symbolic algebra !\n\n\nWeak / penalty boundary conditions\nExample 8 introduced the idea of penalty-based boundary conditions where the constraint is weakly enforced by providing a large penalty for violation of the condition. This is very flexible as the penalizing conditions can be adjusted during the run, including changing which part of the boundary is subject to constraints based on the solution or a coupled problem. The channel flow model shown below has a boundary condition that depends on a externally sourced model for ponded material at the base that is derived from a simple topography filling algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nLive Image: Stokes flow in a channel with multiple obstructions. Flow is driven from the inlet (a velocity boundary condition). The geometry was contructed with gmsh. This is an example for education which demonstrates the emergence of an large-scale pressure gradient as a result of the presence of the obstructions, and also the dispersion of tracers through the complicated flow geometry\nThe penalty approach does allow the solution to deviate from the exact value of the boundary condition, in a similar way to the iterative solvers delivering a solution to within a specified tolerance. There are some cases, for example, enforcing plate motions at the surface, where there are uncertainties in the applied boundary conditions and that these uncertainties may vary in space and time.\n\n\nMesh Adaptation\nIt is also possible to use the PETSc mesh adaption capabilities, to refine the resolution of a model where it is most needed and coarsen elsewhere. Dynamically-adapting meshes are possible but the interface is very low level at present, particularly in parallel.\n\n\n\n\nLive Image: Static mesh adaptation to the slope of a field. The driving buoyancy term is a plume-like upwelling and the slope of this field is shown in colour (red high, blue low). Don’t forget to zoom in !\n\n    # t is the driving \"temperature\". We form an isotropic refinement metric from its slope\n\n    refinement_fn = 1.0 + sympy.sqrt(\n          t.diff(x) ** 2\n        + t.diff(y) ** 2\n        + t.diff(z) ** 2\n    )\n\n    icoord, meshA = adaptivity.mesh_adapt_meshVar(mesh0, refinement_fn, Metric, redistribute=True)",

This notebook also show you how to use the pyvista visualisation tools for Underworld3 objects. The mesh holds information on the mesh geometry, boundaries and coordinate systems.\n\n\nNotebook 2 - Mesh Variables\nVariables: Introduces the concept of MeshVariables in Underworld3. These are both data containers and sympy symbolic objects. We show you how to inspect a meshVariable, set the data values in the MeshVariable and visualise them.\n\n\nNotebook 3 - Symbols and sympy\nSymbols: meshVariables are sympy objects that can be composed with other symbolic objects and evaluated numerically when required. They can also be differentiated. Most importantly, sympy can manipulate expressions, simplify them and cancel terms.\n\n\nNotebook 4 - Example: Diffusion Equation\nDiffusion Solver: Introduces the various solver templates that are available in Underworld, starting with a steady-state diffusion problem. The template requires you to set some constitutive properties and define the unknowns. These are handled through subsitution into symbolic forms and the template equation can be inspected before you need to supply concrete expressions.\n\n\nNotebook 5 - Example: Stokes Equation\nStokes Solver: Stokes equation is a more complicated system of equations to solve. This complexity is mostly hidden when you set the problem up. There are some interesting ways to constrain boundary values which are demonstrated using an annulus mesh (curved, free-slip boundaries) and a \\(\\delta\\) function buoyancy source.\n\n\nNotebook 6 - Example: Time Dependence\nTimestepping: Coupled Stokes flow plus thermal advection-diffusion gives a simple convection solver.

The mesh holds information on the mesh geometry, boundaries and coordinate systems and you can attach data to the mesh (see Notebook 2: Variables).\n\nimport underworld3 as uw\nimport numpy as np\nimport sympy\n\n\nUnderworld meshing module\nUnderworld can read mesh definition files from the gmsh package but there are some constraints on how to specify boundaries if those meshes are to be used to solve numerical problems.\nThe underworld.meshing module has a collection of gmsh (python) examples for common, simple meshes.\n\nmesh = uw.meshing.uw.meshing.CubedSphere(\n    radiusOuter=1.0,\n    radiusInner=0.547,\n    numElements=8,\n    refinement=0,\n    simplex=True,\n    verbose=True,\n)\n\nConstructing UW mesh from gmsh .meshes/uw_cubed_spherical_shell_ro1.0_ri0.547_elts8_plexTrue.msh\nMesh refinement levels: 0\nMesh coarsening levels: None\nPopulating mesh coordinates CoordinateSystemType.SPHERICAL\n\n\n\n\nMesh coordinate arrays\nIf you need to check the physical coordinates of the mesh, there is a data array\n    mesh.data\nwhich is a read-only numpy view of the coordinates (on the local segment of the mesh when running in parallel)\n\nmesh.data\n\narray([[ 0.57735027,  0.57735027, -0.57735027],\n       [-0.57735027,  0.57735027, -0.57735027],\n       [-0.57735027, -0.57735027, -0.57735027],\n       ...,\n       [ 0.61340251,  0.4866531 ,  0.41538064],\n       [ 0.56556024,  0.42209717,  0.44274422],\n       [ 0.51755571,  0.41031492,  0.44421012]])\n\n\nThere are other pre-built meshes you can try.

It also has a spherical \\((r, \\theta, \\phi)\\) system which is symbolic and can be expanded in terms of the Cartesian coordinates.\n\n## The coordinate system\n\nX = mesh.CoordinateSystem.X\nR = mesh.CoordinateSystem.R\n\ndisplay(X)\ndisplay(R)\ndisplay(uw.function.expression.unwrap(R))\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\mathrm{x} & \\mathrm{y} & \\mathrm{z}\\end{matrix}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}r & \\theta & \\phi\\end{matrix}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{x}^{2} + \\mathrm{y}^{2} + \\mathrm{z}^{2}} & \\operatorname{acos}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{z}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{x}^{2} + \\mathrm{y}^{2} + \\mathrm{z}^{2}}} \\right)} & \\operatorname{atan}_{2}{\\left(\\mathrm{y},\\mathrm{x} \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\n\nMesh information\nmesh.view() allows you to interrogate the mesh to identify the mesh data structures (which means you can find by name any variable that is automatically constructed by, for example, one of the numerical solvers).\nIt also identifies boundaries of the mesh and their sizes when distributed in parallel.

These are both data containers and sympy symbolic objects. We show you how to inspect a meshVariable, set the data values in the MeshVariable and visualise them, and build expressions that sympy can understand, manipulate and simplify.\nThis example shows how we can add a scalar field with a single value associated with each mesh node, and a vector field which has quadratic interpolation (points at the nodes plus interpolating points along mesh edges).\nTo set values of the variable, we first have to unlock it using the access context manager, and then we can evaluate a function at the coordinates appropriate to fill up each variable. The locking is a PETSc requirement which is used to make sure data remains synchronised when we run code in parallel.\nVariables are like most underworld and PETSc objects - they can be examined using their view() method. The information that you will see is split into the underworld representation (listed under MeshVariable) and the PETSc representation (listed under FE Data which also includes the numerical values).\nThe meshVariable code is described API docs here.\nmesh._mark_faces_inside_and_out()\npoints = np.array([(0.0,0.75,0.0), (0.0,0.0,0.1)])\nmesh.get_closest_local_cells(points)\n\nClosest points (2,)\n\n\narray([2195,   -1])\nmesh.test_if_points_in_cells( points, np.array([2195,\n       2829]))\n\narray([ True, False])\nmesh.faces_inner_control_points.shape\n# (4, 7615, 3)\n\n(4, 7615, 3)",

    "text": "Symbolic forms, derivatives\nUnderworld is deeply integrated with sympy (www.sympy.org) so that any mesh variable can also be used in a sympy expression.

They can also be differentiated. Most importantly, sympy can manipulate expressions, simplify them and cancel terms.\nIn the examples below, we use a simple 2D, Cartesian mesh because it is much simpler to see the various changes.\nAs before, we add discrete variables\nVariables can be part of complicated sympy expressions.

    "text": "Underworld Expressions\nWe often want to define symbols that represent complicated expressions which do not want to expand when we probe the mathematical formulation.\nAn example might be a constitutive model that has a number of conditional expressions, or a concept such as a timestep which we want to refer to as \\(\\delta t\\) regardless of its current numerical value.\nUnderworld expressions are objects that have a sympy symbolic representation that is only expanded at the time numerical evaluations are required.

    "text": "The Poisson (Diffusion) Solver\nIntroduces the various solver templates that are available in Underworld, starting with a steady-state diffusion problem. The template requires you to set some constitutive properties and define the unknowns. These are handled through subsitution into symbolic forms and the template equation can be inspected before you need to supply concrete expressions.\nIn this example, we solve a steady, non-linear, scalar diffusion equation and show how to recover the fluxes\nThere are a number of pre-defined solver systems defined in underworld3 which are templates for orchestrating the underlying PETSc objects. A solver requires us to define the unknown in the form of meshVariables, provide boundary conditions, a constitutive model, and provide uw.functions to define constitutive properties, and driving terms.\nWe will use the Poisson solver for the diffusion equation, and we will use a Projection solver to compute the vertical gradient term.\nThe Projection solvers compute the meshVariable representation of the right hand side of the equation (potentially requiring some smoothing to regularise the problem). This is required when computing numerical values of gradients, for example, where the values are often not formally defined on the mesh points of the meshVariable. This can also be used to transfer information from discontinous variables to continuous representations when you need to visualise a field.\nThe solver classes themselves (the templates for specific solvers) are separately documented, so we can figure out what is needed before we define anything:\nuw.systems.Poisson.view()\n\nPoisson Equation Solver\nThis class provides functionality for a discrete representation of the Poisson equation\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot\n        \\color{Blue}{\\underbrace{\\Bigl[ \\boldsymbol\\kappa \\nabla u \\Bigr]}_{\\mathbf{F}}} =\n        \\color{Maroon}{\\underbrace{\\Bigl[ f \\Bigl] }_{\\mathbf{h}}}\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) relates the flux to gradients in the unknown \\(u\\)\n\nProperties\n\nThe unknown is \\(u\\)\nThe diffusivity tensor, \\(\\kappa\\) is provided by setting the constitutive_model property to one of the scalar uw.constitutive_models classes and populating the parameters.

The timestepping loop is written by hand because usually you will want to do some analysis or output some checkpoints.\nTo read more about the applications of simple mantle convection models like this one, see (for example) Schubert et al, 2001.\nWe create the Stokes solver as we did in the previous notebook. The buoyancy force is proportional to the temperature anomaly (t_soln). Solvers can either be provided with unknowns as pre-defined meshVariables, or they will define their own.

    "text": "The Navier-Stokes Solver\nWe’ll look at tracking an unsteady flow using a swarm of particle flow-tracers. In this case, the flow is unsteady because we solve the Navier-Stokes equation (that is, the flow has inertia) and we impose an impulsive, initial boundary velocity.\nTo begin with, the set up follows the same path as all previous notebooks: - Create a mesh - Add some variables - Create the solver we need (NavierStokes this time) - Add boundary conditions and constitutive properties.\nWe also add a projection solver to compute the vorticity of the flow as we did in Notebook 4 when we needed to compute a heat-flux (thermal gradient) term.\nTo track the time evolution of the flow, we introduce a “passive” particle swarm. Passive, here, refers to the fact that the flow is not changed by the presence of the marker particles.\nIn the time-loop we have to update the particle locations and we keep this as an explicity operation, in general, because it provide the opportunity for you to make changes or perform analyses. In this case, we are adding new particles near the inflow to track the flow.\nTo learn more about flow goverened by the Navier-Stokes equation, it may be he helpful to read an elementary fluid dynamics textbook and reproduce some of the simple “toy” examples. For example, Acheson, 1990.\nThe Navier-Stokes solver is a combination of a Stokes solver with time-dependent terms for both the Flux history and velocity history. These are orchestrated behind the scenes but some user-accessible options can be set, and full introspection is available using the view methods.\nThe velocity history terms are implemented using uw.systems.ddt objects (Eulerian, Semi-Lagrangian (default), or Lagrangian). Use navier_stokes.DFDt.view(class_documentation=True) and navier_stokes.DuDt.view(class_documentation=True) for more information.\nThe ddt objects implement the Adams-Moulton schemes for flux-terms (order=1 implemented the well-known Crank-Nicholson scheme). For the velocity history term, backward differentiation formulae are used. Introspection for the NS solver shows how the various terms combine to form the full set of equations.\nuw.systems.NavierStokes.view()\n\nNavier-Stokes Equation Solver\nThis class provides a solver for the Navier-Stokes (vector Advection-Diffusion) equation which is similar to that used in the Semi-Lagrange Crank-Nicholson method (Spiegelman & Katz, 2006) but using a distributed sampling of upstream values taken from an arbitrary swarm variable.\n\\[\n\\color{Green}{\\underbrace{ \\Bigl[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u} }{\\partial t} +\n                                  \\left( \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\right) \\mathbf{u} \\ \\Bigr]}_{\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}}} -\n    \\nabla \\cdot\n        \\color{Blue}{\\underbrace{\\Bigl[ \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}{2} \\left(\n                \\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^T \\right) - p \\mathbf{I} \\Bigr]}_{\\mathbf{F}}} =\n        \\color{Maroon}{\\underbrace{\\Bigl[ \\mathbf{f} \\Bigl] }_{\\mathbf{h}}}\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) relates diffusive fluxes to gradients in the unknown \\(u\\). The advective flux that results from having gradients along the direction of transport (given by the velocity vector field \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) ) are included in the \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}\\) term.\nThe term \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}\\) involves upstream sampling to find the value \\(u^{ * }\\) which represents the value of \\(u\\) at the beginning of the timestep. This is achieved using a swarmVariable that carries history information along the flow path. A dense sampling is required to achieve similar accuracy to the original SLCN approach but it allows the use of a single swarm for history tracking of variables with different interpolation order and for material tracking. The user is required to supply and update the swarmVariable representing \\(u^{ * }\\)\n\nProperties\n\nThe unknown is \\(u\\).\nThe history variable is \\(u^*\\) and is provided in the form of a sympy function. It is the user’s responsibility to keep this variable updated.\nThe diffusivity tensor, \\(\\kappa\\) is provided by setting the constitutive_model property to one of the scalar uw.constitutive_models classes and populating the parameters. It is usually a constant or a function of position / time and may also be non-linear or anisotropic.\nVolumetric sources of \\(u\\) are specified using the \\(f\\) property and can be any valid combination of sympy functions of position and meshVariable or swarmVariable types.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nThe solver requires relatively high order shape functions to accurately interpolate the history terms. Spiegelman & Katz recommend cubic or higher degree for \\(u\\) but this is not checked.\n\n\n\nReferences\nSpiegelman, M., & Katz, R. F. (2006).

    "text": "Deform the mesh\nWe used a particle swarm to track the flow in Example 7. We called this a “passive” swarm because the points did not influence the flow in any way but were simply carried along with the fluid.\nParticle swarms are unstructured data objects that live within the computational domain. Their points can be moved arbitrarily through the domain and points may migrate from one process to another when the coordinates are changed. By default they carry only the particle location, but we can add scalar, vector and tensor variables to the swarm and they will be transported with the particles.\nParticle transport is usually through a velocity or displacement field that incrementally changes the locations. This is a common use, but particles can be used to represent any unstructured field. For example, during mesh adaptation, the nodal points from the previous mesh are equivalent to a disconnected swarm from the point of view of the new mesh. The same is true when reading data save from one mesh to the MeshVariables on another.\nMove all nodes down to meet an undulating lower surface. The displacement field is smooth and continuous, so there is no particular need to remesh in this case. However, it is generally better to consider either deforming the mesh with gmsh before triangulation, or remeshing (both are possible with underworld3, but not as simple to demonstrate).\nnew_coords = mesh.data\ndy = (1 - y) * (sympy.sin(sympy.pi * x) / 10)\nnew_coords[:, 1] = uw.function.evaluate(y - dy, mesh.data)\n\ndisplay(dy)\n\nmesh.deform_mesh(new_coords)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\left(1 - \\mathrm{y}\\right) \\sin{\\left(\\mathrm{x} \\pi \\right)}}{10}\\)\n# y coordinate after 1st deformation\ny1 = uw.discretisation.MeshVariable(\n    \"Y1\", mesh, vtype=uw.VarType.SCALAR, varsymbol=r\"y_1\"\n)\n\nwith mesh.access(y1):\n    y1.data[:, 0] = uw.function.evaluate(y, y1.coords)\n\nVariable with name Y1 already exists on the mesh - Skipping.",
