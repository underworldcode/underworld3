  abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) combined with unstructured meshes forms an elegant and versatile approach capable of dealing with the complexities of problems in Earth science. Practical applications often require high-resolution models that necessitate advanced computational strategies. We therefore developed ``Million a Minute'' (MILAMIN), an efficient MATLAB implementation of FEM that is capable of setting up, solving, and postprocessing two-dimensional problems with one million unknowns in one minute on a modern desktop computer. MILAMIN allows the user to achieve numerical resolutions that are necessary to resolve the heterogeneous nature of geological materials. In this paper we provide the technical knowledge required to develop such models without the need to buy a commercial FEM package, programming compiler-language code, or hiring a computer specialist. It has been our special aim that all the components of MILAMIN perform efficiently, individually and as a package. While some of the components rely on readily available routines, we develop others from scratch and make sure that all of them work together efficiently. One of the main technical focuses of this paper is the optimization of the global matrix computations. The performance bottlenecks of the standard FEM algorithm are analyzed. An alternative approach is developed that sustains high performance for any system size. Applied optimizations eliminate Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) drawbacks when multiplying small matrices, reduce operation count and memory requirements when dealing with symmetric matrices, and increase data transfer efficiency by maximizing cache reuse. Applying loop interchange allows us to use BLAS on large matrices. In order to avoid unnecessary data transfers between RAM and CPU cache we introduce loop blocking. The optimization techniques are useful in many areas as demonstrated with our MILAMIN applications for thermal and incompressible flow (Stokes) problems. We use these to provide performance comparisons to other open source as well as commercial packages and find that MILAMIN is among the best performing solutions, in terms of both speed and memory usage. The corresponding MATLAB source code for the entire MILAMIN, including input generation, FEM solver, and postprocessing, is available from the authors (               http://www.milamin.org               ) and can be downloaded as auxiliary material.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Firedrake is an automated system for solving partial differential equations using the finite-element method. By applying sophisticated performance optimisations through automatic code-generation techniques, it provides a means of creating accurate, efficient, flexible, easily extensible, scalable, transparent and reproducible research software that is ideally suited to simulating a wide range of problems in geophysical fluid dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of Firedrake for geodynamical simulation, with a focus on mantle dynamics. The accuracy and efficiency of the approach are confirmed via comparisons against a suite of analytical and benchmark cases of systematically increasing complexity, whilst parallel scalability is demonstrated up to 12\,288 compute cores, where the problem size and the number of processing cores are simultaneously increased. In addition, Firedrake's flexibility is highlighted via straightforward application to different physical (e.g. complex non-linear rheologies, compressibility) and geometrical (2-D and 3-D Cartesian and spherical domains) scenarios. Finally, a representative simulation of global mantle convection is examined, which incorporates 230\,Myr of plate motion history as a kinematic surface boundary condition, confirming Firedrake's suitability for addressing research problems at the frontiers of global mantle dynamics research.},

The design of TerraFERMA is driven by two computational needs in Earth sciences. The first is the need for increased flexibility in both problem description and solution strategies for coupled problems where small changes in model assumptions can lead to dramatic changes in physical behavior. The second is the need for software and models that are more transparent so that results can be verified, reproduced, and modified in a manner such that the best ideas in computation and Earth science can be more easily shared and reused. TerraFERMA leverages three advanced open-source libraries for scientific computation that provide high-level problem description (FEniCS), composable solvers for coupled multiphysics problems (PETSc), and an options handling system (SPuD) that allows the hierarchical management of all model options. TerraFERMA integrates these libraries into an interface that organizes the scientific and computational choices required in a model into a single options file from which a custom compiled application is generated and run. Because all models share the same infrastructure, models become more reusable and reproducible, while still permitting the individual researcher considerable latitude in model construction. TerraFERMA solves partial differential equations using the finite element method. It is particularly well suited for nonlinear problems with complex coupling between components. TerraFERMA is open-source and available at               http://terraferma.github.io               , which includes links to documentation and example input files.                        ,              Key Points                                                                We present new software for more reproducible and reusable solutions of multiphysics problems                                                     The software leverages advanced parallel computational libraries                                                                          TerraFERMA is open source and available at                     http://terraferma.github.io},

The central issue for the partial differential equations governing mantle dynamics concerns the rheology governing the flow of mantle rocks under relevant temperature and pressure conditions. The momentum equation is the most computationally intensive portion of this coupled system because of its strongly nonlinear, elliptical character. We review the various discretization methods, ranging from finite differences to finite elements, which have been employed. We present in detail finite-element implementations of the Uzawa algorithm for the momentum equation and of the streamline Petrov--Galerkin algorithm for the energy equation. We review the application of modern techniques such as the Schur complement solvers and least-squares commutator preconditioners in the solution of the elliptical equation. We discuss the computational libraries available for massively parallel simulation and their application to this system of equations and give a preview of approaches suitable for exascale computing, which is a major challenge for the decade ahead.},
