The `Containerfile` is used to build the container and can be used with docker or podman. 
At present only amd64 architecture is built, because vtk-osmesa isn't available for arm by default. This may change in future, or we could build vtk-osmesa from source.

Example use, must be run from repository root.
```bash
   podman build . --rm \
       --format docker \
       -f ./docs/developer/container/Containerfile \ 
       -t underworldcode/underworld3:foobar
```

The `launch-container.sh` is a script for launching the container using `podman` only. Podman is the preferred container runner because of `rootless` support.
Expect the script to take a minute or so to load as permissions are updated. 
Host port 10000 will run the container's default jupyter server. See script for details.
