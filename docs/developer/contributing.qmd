# Contributing Guidelines

::: {.callout-note}

This section will cover:
- Development workflow and Git practices
- Pull request guidelines  
- Code review process
- Community standards
- Issue reporting and feature requests

**Priority**: Medium  
**Current Status**: Placeholder - needs development
:::

## Quick Start

For now, see the [Style Guide](UW3_Style_and_Patterns_Guide.qmd) for coding standards and the [README](UW3_Developers_README.md) for basic development guidelines.

## Areas Needing Contribution

Based on our architecture analysis, these areas need immediate attention:

1. **Expressions & Functions** - Critical user-facing documentation gap
2. **Cython Bridge** - No documentation for Python-C interface  
3. **Meshing Parameters** - Geometric setup guidance missing
4. **Mathematical Module Consistency** - Standardize documentation quality
