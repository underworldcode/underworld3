# Solvers System Documentation

::: {.callout-success}
## Well-Documented Subsystem

**Module**: `systems/solvers.py` (2,255 lines)  
**Priority**: 🟢 Low - already well documented  
**Current Status**: Good documentation ✅

Could benefit from performance tuning guidance.

## Overview

The solvers subsystem provides numerical solvers for PDEs using PETSc's SNES and linear solvers.

### Current State
- **Files**:
  - `solvers.py`: 2,255 lines - 10 main solver classes  
  - `solver_template.py`: 411 lines - Base solver framework
  - `ddt.py`: 1,241 lines - Time derivative implementations
- **Complexity**: Very High - mathematical solver implementations
- **Documentation Quality**: Good ✅

### Core Solvers

```python
# Primary solver types - all well documented
SNES_Poisson          # Elliptic problems
SNES_Stokes           # Incompressible flow
AdvDiffSLCN           # Advection-diffusion (SLCN)
AdvDiffHamilton       # Hamiltonian advection
SteadyStateHeat       # Thermal diffusion
NavierStokesSLCN      # Navier-Stokes flow
```

## Current Documentation Status

### Strengths
- ✅ Mathematical formulations in docstrings
- ✅ Boundary condition examples
- ✅ Solver parameter descriptions
- ✅ Integration with constitutive models

### Enhancement Opportunities
- ⚠️ Performance tuning guidance needed
- ⚠️ Preconditioner selection missing
- Could benefit from optimization examples

## Critical Stability Note

::: {.callout-warning}
## Solver Stability is Paramount

**DO NOT MODIFY** solver internals without extensive benchmarking. These have been optimized over years and are the core of the system. Any documentation additions should focus on usage patterns rather than implementation changes.

## Implementation Tasks

## For Contributors

This well-documented subsystem could benefit from:
- Preconditioner selection guidance
- Performance tuning documentation  
- Convergence analysis examples
- Scaling studies and optimization
- Advanced usage patterns
