# Constitutive Models Documentation

::: {.callout-success}
## Well-Documented Subsystem

**Module**: `constitutive_models.py` (1,967 lines)  
**Priority**: =â Low - already well documented  
**Current Status**: Good documentation 
:::

## Overview

Material physics and rheology implementations with 10 material models covering various physical behaviors.

### Documentation Status
-  Mathematical formulations documented
-  Physical parameters explained  
-  Unit requirements documented
-   Could use parameter selection guidance

This subsystem already has good documentation and serves as a model for documenting complex physics implementations.
