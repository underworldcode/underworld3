# Setting Up Underworld3 Development Environment

::: {.callout-note}
## Coming Soon

This section will cover:
- Pixi environment setup and management
- Required dependencies and versions
- IDE configuration and tools
- Building from source
- Docker development containers

**Priority**: High - needed for new developer onboarding  
**Current Status**: Placeholder - needs development
:::

## Quick Commands

For now, the essential commands are:

```bash
# Build Underworld3
pixi run underworld-build

# Run tests
pixi run underworld-test

# Python environment  
pixi run -e default python script.py
```

## Environment Information

From CLAUDE.md context:
- Uses pixi for environment management
- Key dependencies: underworld3, petsc4py, numpy, scipy
- Must use `pixi run underworld-build` after ANY source code changes
- No in-place builds due to Cython/PETSc complexity
