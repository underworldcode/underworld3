If you use `jupytext` to write notebooks directly as python scripts, then the same notebook codes will run on a parallel machine with no performance penalty.\n\nThe notebooks are rendered as html pages in this guide. They are distributed with the source code on GitHub and can be run on binder.\n\n"

This notebook also show you how to use the `pyvista` visualisation tools for `Underworld3` objects. The mesh holds information on the mesh geometry, boundaries and coordinate systems."

These are both data containers and `sympy` symbolic objects. We show you how to inspect a `meshVariable`, set the data values in the `MeshVariable` and visualise them."

They can also be differentiated. Most importantly, `sympy` can manipulate expressions, simplify them and cancel terms."

The template requires you to set some constitutive properties and define the unknowns. These are handled through subsitution into symbolic forms and the template equation can be inspected before you need to supply concrete expressions.\n\n#### Notebook 5 - Poisson Equation Validation\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [**Poisson Validation**](5-Solvers-i-Poisson-Validation.ipynb): Demonstrates how to validate the Poisson solver against known analytical solutions. We solve three progressively complex diffusion problems with linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal profiles, comparing numerical results against exact solutions."

This complexity is mostly hidden when you set the problem up. There are some interesting ways to constrain boundary values which are demonstrated using an annulus mesh (curved, free-slip boundaries) and a $\\delta$ function buoyancy source."

A step (or a top-hat function) moves left to right with constant velocity and diffusion occurs at the same time. This has an analytic solution so we can see the effect of changing timesteps and grid resolution very easily.\n\n#### Notebook 8 - Coupled Timestepping \n\n\ud83d\udd17 [**Coupled Timestepping**](8-Timestepping-coupled.ipynb): *Coupled* Stokes flow plus thermal advection-diffusion gives a simple convection solver. The timestepping loop is written by hand because usually you will want to do some analysis or output some checkpoints."

Particles need to be added to the passive swarm close to the inflow at each timestep."
