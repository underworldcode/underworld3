# Porous Flow - WIP

Advanced porous flow examples that complete the porous flow physics domain.

## Examples

### `Ex_Explicit_Flow_Grains.ipynb`
**Explicit grain-scale flow modeling**

Advanced simulation of fluid flow around individual grains in porous media using explicit particle representations.

**Topics covered**:
- Grain-scale fluid dynamics
- Explicit particle-fluid coupling
- Multi-scale flow modeling

**Prerequisites**: 
- Understanding of fluid mechanics
- Familiarity with particle methods
- Basic porous media concepts

### `pramoda_stokes.ipynb`
**Stokes flow in porous media**

Detailed analysis of Stokes flow through porous structures with complex boundary conditions.

**Topics covered**:
- Stokes flow formulation
- Porous media boundary conditions
- Flow field analysis and visualization

**Prerequisites**:
- Stokes flow fundamentals
- Porous media theory
- Boundary condition implementation

## Status

These examples complement the porous flow examples in the main documentation:
- **Main docs**: `porous_flow/` contains 6 basic/intermediate examples
- **WIP**: These 2 examples provide advanced techniques
- **Complete coverage**: Now covers full spectrum from basic to research-level

## Integration Notes

When these examples are fully documented and tested, they should be moved to:
- `../porous_flow/advanced/` for research-level examples
- Update main porous flow README with cross-references

## Usage Notes

⚠️ **Status**: Work in progress
- May require code updates for current Underworld3 version
- Documentation incomplete
- Not validated with current test suite

🎯 **Value**: 
- Advanced porous media research
- Grain-scale modeling techniques
- Complete porous flow domain coverage
