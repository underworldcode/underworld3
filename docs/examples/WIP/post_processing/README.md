# Post-Processing - WIP

Advanced visualization and analysis techniques for Underworld3 results.

## Examples

### `Ex_MoresiSolomatov_Convection_Visualisation-Cart.ipynb`
**Complex convection visualization**

Advanced visualization techniques for thermal convection results, specifically demonstrating the Moresi-Solomatov convection benchmark with sophisticated plotting and analysis.

**Topics covered**:
- Advanced convection visualization
- Benchmark result analysis
- Multi-field plotting techniques
- Quantitative flow analysis
- Publication-quality figures

**Prerequisites**:
- Understanding of thermal convection
- Familiarity with convection benchmarks
- Basic visualization concepts
- Knowledge of Moresi-Solomatov benchmark

## Integration Notes

This example complements the post-processing utilities:
- **Main docs**: `utilities/` contains basic visualization examples
- **WIP**: Advanced analysis and publication-quality visualization
- **Target**: Research and publication workflows

## Technical Details

**Benchmark context**:
- Classic thermal convection benchmark case
- Quantitative validation against analytical solutions
- Advanced flow field analysis techniques

**Visualization features**:
- Multi-panel figure layouts
- Streamline and vector field plotting
- Quantitative analysis overlays
- Time series and statistical analysis

## Usage Notes

⚠️ **Status**: Work in progress
- May require updates for current visualization APIs
- Dependencies on specific plotting libraries
- Not validated with current test suite

🎯 **Value for**:
- **Research publications** - High-quality figure generation
- **Benchmark validation** - Quantitative comparison tools
- **Advanced analysis** - Beyond basic visualization
- **Education** - Demonstrating analysis techniques

## Future Integration

When complete, this should be moved to:
- `../utilities/advanced/` for advanced visualization
- Create integration with basic post-processing examples
- Add to main visualization documentation

## Dependencies

Likely requires additional visualization libraries:
- Advanced plotting packages
- Possibly VTK/ParaView integration
- Specific benchmark data formats
