Thermal convection combines heat transfer and fluid mechanics to model buoyancy-driven flows. This is fundamental to understanding mantle convection, atmospheric circulation, and many other geophysical processes.

## 🎯 Learning Progression

### 📚 Basic Examples (`basic/`)

**Foundation concepts for thermal convection.**

1. **Rayleigh-Benard Convection** - `rayleigh_benard_2d.py`
   - Classical onset of convection in a heated layer
   - Critical Rayleigh number and instability
   - Introduces: coupled heat-flow, buoyancy forces

2. **Convection Onset Analysis** - `linear_stability_analysis.py`
   - Theoretical vs numerical critical Rayleigh numbers
   - Mode shapes and growth rates
   - Introduces: eigenvalue problems, instability theory

3. **Steady Convection Cells** - `steady_convection_rolls.py`
   - Finite amplitude convection above critical Ra
   - Heat transfer efficiency (Nusselt number)
   - Introduces: non-linear solutions, heat flux calculations

### 🔬 Intermediate Examples (`intermediate/`)

**More realistic convection scenarios.**

4. **Temperature-Dependent Viscosity** - `variable_viscosity_convection.py`
   - Exponentially varying viscosity with temperature
   - Boundary layer formation and focusing
   - Introduces: strongly non-linear rheology effects

5. **Internal Heating** - `internally_heated_convection.py`

7. **Annulus Convection, Recorded** - `Ex_Convection_Annulus_Recorded.py`
   - Boussinesq convection in a 2D annulus, written in the timestepping pattern
   - Reference quantities first, so the buoyancy is written as a force and the
     Rayleigh number falls out of the nondimensionalisation
   - Rotated free-slip on the curved boundaries; a varying `estimate_dt()`
   - Demonstrates the run's own record: the transcript, a rejected step, a
     bit-exact replay, and a step taken twice showing in the record

## 🧮 Mathematical Background

### Coupled Equations
**Momentum Balance (Boussinesq Approximation):**
```
0 = -∇p + η∇²v + ρ₀gα(T-T₀)ẑ
∇·v = 0
```

**Energy Balance:**
```
∂T/∂t + v·∇T = κ∇²T + H/ρcp
```

### Key Dimensionless Parameters

**Rayleigh Number:**
```
Ra = ρ₀gαΔTL³/(ηκ)
```
- Controls convection vigor
- Critical value Ra_c ≈ 1708 for onset

**Prandtl Number:**
```
Pr = η/(ρκ) = ν/κ
```
- Momentum vs thermal diffusion
- Earth's mantle: Pr >> 1 (thermal boundary layers)

**Nusselt Number:**
```
Nu = qL/(kΔT)
```
- Heat transfer efficiency
- Nu = 1 for pure conduction, Nu > 1 for convection
