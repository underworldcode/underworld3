# Advanced Usage

Master advanced Underworld3 techniques for research-grade simulations.

## Topics

### Parallel Computing
Write MPI-safe scripts and understand domain decomposition.

**[→ Parallel Computing Guide](parallel-computing.md)**

### Performance Optimization  
Profile, optimize, and scale your simulations.

**[→ Performance Guide](performance.md)**

### Complex Rheologies
Implement advanced material models and constitutive laws.

**[→ Complex Rheologies](complex-rheologies.md)**

### Mesh Adaptation
Dynamic remeshing and adaptive refinement strategies.

**[→ Mesh Adaptation](mesh-adaptation.md)**

### Troubleshooting
Common issues, debugging strategies, and solutions.

**[→ Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)**
