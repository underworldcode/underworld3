## Exercises

Add questions to include in the JB ... don't add answers because a private repo
cannot be clones to jupyterhub with nbgitpuller.

::::{admonition} Q1 - How to create a question

Suppose you want to create a series of textbook style questions for your jupyterbook. 
The goal might be just to have a bunch of questions to choose from or it may be that you would 
like to release a worksheet.

Try using a general jupyterbook admonition to create a question card and see if that works for you.
