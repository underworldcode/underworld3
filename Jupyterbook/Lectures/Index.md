# Lectures and Tutorials for Underworld 3

Two examples of lecture notes and simple slideshows that we can embed.

The lecture notes are in standard `myst markdown` format like the rest of the book.

The slideshows are built along with the book using `reveal-md`. They are supposed to 
be very simple, versionable (text based, not binaries) and rely on external links for
complicated media such as large movies.
